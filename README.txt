Dependencies:
nmp install nodejs
nmp install mongodb
nmp install mongojs

To run the server from the .vbs file, edit the path name to point
to your node.exe root directory for example:

"cmd /k cd /d 'PATH TO node.exe - Remove quotes' && node nodeJS-monoDB-monojs-app\server.js"
to 
"cmd /k cd /d d:\nodejs && node nodeJS-monoDB-monojs-app\server.js"

- Once the dependencies have been set up running the serverStart.vbs with the correct path name will execute the server
- Once the server is running you should get successive console logs indicating the server is conneted
- Either run the index.html file from the project directory or browse to http://localhost:8080 from a web browser

if everything has worked correctly you will see some output messages in the server console and the index.html will
be connected to the mongoDB databse..
